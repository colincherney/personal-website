        <p>
          Hello! I'm Colin Cherney, a recent graduate from Arizona State
          University with a BS in Computer Information Systems. I'm passionate
          about technology and its potential to solve real-world problems.
        </p>

        <p>
          My journey in the world of technology & business began during my high
          school years in Hartford, Wisconsin. Since then, I've been constantly
          learning and expanding my skills in various areas of computer science,
          information systems, and business.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am interested in many different areas of information technology and
          business including: software development, cybersecurity, business
          analysis, consulting, tech sales and anything that allows me to take
          on new challenges and projects that help me to grow both personally
          and professionally.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I am not working or developing new projects I like to travel
          whenever possible, workout at the gym, sit out by the pool or beach,
          play video games, go for a hike or walk, and try to learn new things
          that I am interested in.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm excited about the future of technology and look forward to
          contributing to innovative solutions that make a positive impact on
          the world.
        </p>
